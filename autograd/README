# Autograd

Automatic differentiation engine that implements a Torch-like API and targets
CUDA, TT-Metal, and {MLIR/TVM/ONNX}. Formalizations of convex optimizers such as
gradient descent, mirror descent, and non-convex optimizers, hessian descent, and
noisy gradient descent can be found in [README.tex](./README.tex)
