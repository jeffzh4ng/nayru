**nayru: software 2.0 compiler**

- [models](./models/README)
- [nayrugrad](./autograd/README)

Deep learning compiler that implements a Torch-like API for both training and
inference. Targets CUDA, TT, and ONNX. The first goal is to bootstrap correctness
by reproducing SD and GPT2 on CUDA. The second goal is to improve training and
inference speeds for both vision and language. The third goal is to support TT and
ONNX backend targets.
