**a software 2.0 compiler: rstorch -> CUDA**

- [models](./models/README)
- [rstorch](./rstorch/README)

The first goal is to bootstrap `rstorch.tensor` and `rstorch.autograd` correctness
by 1. creating a trusted SD/GPT2 implementations with `pytorch`, `jax`, `mojo`,
and `tinygrad` 2. reproducing the weights once again but with `rstorch`.

The second goal is to saturate model training on the the 1/10th petaflop
available with two nvlinked 3090s via CUDA and Triton kernels â€” 20% of the
optimizations will be implemented to unlock 80% of the perf[0].

The third goal is to improve multi machine perf with NCCL and MPI.
